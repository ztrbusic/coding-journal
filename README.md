# 🧠 Coding Journal

This is my personal coding journal — a log of what I learn, build, struggle with, and plan to explore next. It helps me stay consistent, reflect on my progress, and track how my skills grow over time.

---

## 📅 How it's organized

- **Daily bullet notes** are stored in the `/daily-bullets/` folder – short, quick notes on what I did or learned that day.
- **Weekly summaries** are stored in the `/weekly-logs/` folder – longer reflections that capture progress, struggles, and next steps.

---

## ✅ What I include

### In daily bullets:
- Quick 1–4 bullet points (what I did, learned, or got stuck on)
- Optional notes, code, or reminders

### In weekly logs:
- **What I did this week** – Projects, exercises, time spent
- **What I learned** – Key takeaways, concepts, syntax, tools
- **Questions / Things to explore** – Stuff I’m curious about or need to revisit
- **Notes** – Reflections, next steps, random thoughts

---

## 🧱 Why I'm doing this

- Track real progress, not just big milestones
- Make learning visible and searchable
- Build a habit of writing and reviewing
- Turn daily effort into a long-term asset

---

## 🛠️ Tools I'm using

- **Python** (main language right now)
- **GitHub Desktop** for version control
- **Markdown** for logging
- Sometimes I include screenshots, terminal output, or code snippets
