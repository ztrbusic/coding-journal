# 🧠 Coding Journal

This is my personal coding journal — a daily log of what I learn, build, struggle with, and plan to explore next. It helps me stay consistent, reflect on my progress, and track how my skills grow over time.

---

## 📅 How it's organized

Each log is saved in the `logs/` folder, using this format:

---

## ✅ What I include in each entry

- **What I did today** – Tasks, experiments, projects, problems solved
- **What I learned** – Key takeaways, concepts, syntax, tools
- **Questions / Things to explore** – Stuff I’m curious about or stuck on
- **Notes** – Reflections, random thoughts, next steps

---

## 🧱 Why I'm doing this

- Track real progress, not just big milestones
- Make learning visible and searchable
- Build a habit of writing and reviewing
- Turn daily effort into a long-term asset

---

## 🛠️ Tools I'm using

- **Python** (main language right now)
- **GitHub Desktop** for version control
- **Markdown** for logging
- Sometimes I include screenshots, terminal output, or code snippets
