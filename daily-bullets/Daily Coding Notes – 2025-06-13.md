## 🗓️ Daily Coding Notes – 2025-06-13

- Finished the Collatz sequence program with input validation using `try/except` and `while True:` — now handles invalid input smoothly
- Understood how `number = collatz(number)` works by capturing the return value of the function and updating the variable in-place
- Explored `for i in range(x)` — clarified how `range()` works, what values it yields, and how `i` is stored and reused during looping
- Broke down `enumerate()` — learned it always returns two values `(index, item)`, and that variable names don’t affect the data order
- Examined how `someList[random.randint(0, len(someList) - 1)]` selects a random item using index bounds
