## 🗓️ Daily Coding Notes – 2025-06-12

- Learned the difference between `print()` and `return` inside functions; finally understood why `print(say_hi())` shows two lines
- Got clear on local vs global scope — tested how `global` really modifies outside variables
- Realized `None` shows up when a function doesn’t return anything — not a bug, just Python logic
- Discovered that strings can be multiplied with integers (e.g., `"*"` * 5), and practiced using `end=''` in `print()`
